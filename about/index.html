              <p>
                Catholics United for the Faith (CUF) is an international lay apostolate, i.e. an association of lay Catholics committed to spreading the kingdom of Christ throughout the world, founded in 1968 in response to the Second Vatican Council Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity (<em>Apostolicam Actuositatem</em>) in order to support, defend and advance the efforts of the teaching Church.
              </p>
              <p>
                Vatican II declared that “The Church was founded to spread the kingdom of Christ over all the earth for the glory of God the Father, to make all men partakers in redemption and salvation, and through them to establish the right relationship of the entire world to Christ,” adding “Every activity of the Mystical Body of Christ with this in view goes by the name of ‘apostolate’” (<em>Apostolicam Actuositatem</em> 20).

            <div class="section-content">
              <p>
                The guiding principles of CUF are embodied first of all in the official teachings of the Magisterium of the Church, i.e. the bishops teaching in union with the Pope, and in particular in the Vatican II Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity. It is the firm policy of CUF never to deviate from the teaching of the Magisterium, whether in matters of doctrine or of discipline, since only in this way can we guarantee the absolute fidelity of CUF to the Pope and bishops, and thus the Church, and thus to Christ.
              </p>

            <h3 class="section-subtitle">How We are Organized</h3>
            <div class="section-content">
              <p>
                Catholics United for the Faith is organized as a private association of the lay faithful in accord with the discipline of the Catholic Church. It is incorporated in civil law as a Minnesota non-profit corporation duly registered in the State of Ohio. CUF’s organizational structure includes: a governing board of directors, an executive committee of that same board, officers, and departments. Each level within the structure is entrusted with certain functions and authority as established in the association’s statutes, articles of incorporation, and by-laws.
              </p>

            <h3 class="section-subtitle">Fulfilling our Mission</h3>
            <div class="section-content">
              <p>
                Catholics United for the Faith fulfills its purpose through its various outreaches. With the exception of the Business Office, all outreaches must have a purpose that directly reflects the efforts of the Teaching Church. No outreach can exist without the express approval of the board. In accord with the criteria set forth in the statutes of the association, this approval is given after consideration of the proposed purpose, and how the proposed outreach will complement existing outreaches in accomplishing the mission of CUF. The performance and cooperation of each outreach within the apostolate as a whole is to be reviewed at least annually by the board according to the means established in the statutes of the association.

            <div class="section-content">
              <p>
                Catholics United for the Faith (CUF) is an international lay apostolate, building on the only sure foundation for happiness and renewal of the family and society: the teachings of Jesus Christ and His Church.
              </p>
              <p>
                Founded by H. Lyman Stebbins in 1968 to support, defend, and advance the efforts of the teaching Church, CUF has helped tens of thousands of people discover and strengthen their Catholic faith.

              </p>
              <p>
                In February of 2017 CUF affiliated to another Catholic apostolate, the St. Joseph Foundation (SJF). Both apostolates remain corporately and financially distinct. This means that when you make a donation to CUF, 100% of that donation is received by CUF. The same is true for donations made to SJF. The organizations’ two Boards of Directors now share members and both apostolates operate under the direction of a single president, Philip Gray. They also share office space and administrative costs, which allows both apostolates to keep infrastructure costs down and put more of their budgets directly into advancing their missions.

              <p>
                Catholics United for the Faith is called an apostolate because membership is ordered to apostolic action. Members first seek personal holiness, so that, should it be God’s will, they are ready instruments for apostolic action.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a lay apostolate, Catholics United for the Faith provides a cooperative structure through which the laity can be effective in their vocation.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    While an individual might have limited resources, the combined resources of thousands united in effort bring about a greater effect.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    When an individual seeks to express himself, he remains but one voice, whereas combined with others in an apostolate, his voice is amplified.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    In turn, the individual benefits from association, through resources and support, in living out his personal vocation.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                Whether a person is consecrated, married, single, or ordained; members of an ecclesial movement, religious order, or secular; adherents of a particular piety, spirituality, or devotion; CUF advances the general call to holiness and vocation of the laity and supports each individual’s personal call, however that is manifested.
