              <em><b>In the wake of Vatican II, many Catholics were confused. Many were in error. Had the Church changed her teachings? A courageous group of laymen banded together in 1968 to defend the Truth. The Truth is, the Church did not change her Teachings. The Mystical Body of Christ was under attack then and remains under attack now. As in 1968, her enemies come from within and without. Our Mother still needs to be defended. That is what Catholics United for the Faith was founded for, and that is what we do today.</b></em>

                Catholics United for the Faith (CUF) is an international lay apostolate founded to unite the Faithful from all walks of like in order to support, defend, and advance the Teaching Office of the Catholic Church. CUF is faithful to the Magisterium of the Church, holding that the Church is indefectible and will not fail, that Her teachings can develop but never fundamentally change. CUF seeks to support the hierarchy in proclaiming the saving truths, but is not afraid to warn the faithful against error and immorality wherever it appears. CUF is committed to assisting Catholics of all states in life to participate in the Church’s apostolic activity, reform existing activities, and even found their own apostolates where this is needed. In these ways, CUF pursues and supports authentic Church Reform.

                CUF fulfills the objective of defending the Church, and of uniting the faithful of all states in life to defend the Church, in practical ways such as:

              <p>
                CUF, and its mission, were the fruit of much prayer and discussion by a group of devout laymen concerned with a wide array of attacks and distortions facing the Catholic Church. Matters came to a head with the publication of Pope Paul VI’s Humanae Vitae, and the immediate wave of dissent it garnered from a large number of bishops, priests, and theologians. In the face of such scandalous revolt, CUF’s founders felt compelled to serve as lay witnesses of fidelity to Peter, to the Church, and thus to Christ. These founders of CUF never dreamed of how influential the apostolate would be, but they knew what needed to be done.

                In 2014, the President of CUF recommended that the apostolate wind down operations and dissolve. The Board of Directors rejected the proposal, Over the next two years, a painful transition began. CUF sold its office space and all real estate. Emmaus Road Publishing was sold to the Saint Paul Center, and all staff except the Executive Vice President were hired by Saint Paul Center to continue running Emmaus Road. CUF’s library was given away. It’s business files and some of its research was moved to storage. CUF’s Executive Vice President, Shannon Minch-Hughes, continued to fulfill requests for FAITH FACTS and any other request she was able to fulfill. Publication of Lay Witness was suspended.
              </p>
              <p>
                During this time, discussions began with The Saint Joseph Foundation (SJF) to acquire CUF in some way. Philip Gray, the President of SJF, served as Director of Information Services at CUF from 1998 – 2001. From 2000 – 2001, he also served as Director of Development and Membership Services. Wanting to preserve the essential mission of CUF, he proposed that CUF be affiliated to SJF. In this way, CUF would remain an autonomous Catholic apostolate with no change to its structure with one exception: the Directors and Officers of SJF would be ex officio Directors and Officers of CUF. The proposal was accepted by both Boards of Directors, and on February 4, 2017, CUF became affiliated to SJF.

                This arrangement allowed CUF to move its operations into the offices of SJF. The exceptional research library and files of SJF became available to CUF. The arrangement provided all the essential elements needed to continue CUF’s Mission. By sharing office space and resources with SJF, both apostolates are able to support each other’s complimentary missions. Best of all, because SJF was a sister apostolate of CUF, the Directors and Officers of SJF value the Mission and work of CUF in the Church. Since 2017, the two apostolates have supported each other in every way possible without altering their own identities or missions. Two sisters under one roof.
