      <i>Lay Witness</i> has been published by CUF from its earliest days. It is a bi-monthly newsletter intended to supplement the formation of members and associates. CUF uses <i>Lay Witness</i> to coordinate the efforts of its members and associates in pursuing the Mission of CUF. Each issue contains a lead article focused on a specific topic relevant to a current issue in the Church. CUF’s authors examine each issue in light of official Church teaching and discipline. Each issue also contains information about the activities of CUF’s international office and chapters.

      Between 1997 and 2014, <i>Lay Witness</i> was published as a full color magazine. Each issue contained over a dozen articles from highly acclaimed Bible scholars, apologists and bishops. Regrettably, <i>Lay Witness</i> was not published between 2014 and 2017. With the affiliation of CUF to The Saint Joseph Foundation, CUF resumed publication of <i>Lay Witness</i> as a newsletter, just as in its first decades of service.
