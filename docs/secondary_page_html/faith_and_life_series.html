  <div class="section-content">
    <p>
      At the time of its publication in the 1980’s, the Faith and Life catechism series was hailed
      as a breakthrough in the field of religious education. As a comprehensive catechetical
      program, it combines beautiful classical and original artwork with a solid doctrinal and
      scriptural presentation in an easy-to-read and stimulating format praised by parents,
      teachers, and students.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Faith and Life religious education series is now in its Third Edition, with texts and
      activities fully adapted to the new translation of the Roman Missal implemented in Advent
      2011. The Faith and Life Third Edition presents Catholic teaching using the time-tested
      ecclesial methodology and spiral development of catechesis in a beautiful, student-friendly,
      comprehensive format.
    </p>
    <p>
      The series is an excellent choice for Catholic schools, parish catechetical programs, and
      home-schooling families.
