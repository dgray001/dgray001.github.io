      “The harvest indeed is great, but the labourers are few” (Mt. 9:37, DRV).
    </p>
    <p>
      “For the scripture saith: Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn: and, The labourer is worthy of his reward” (1 Tim. 5:18, DRV).

      As we work to support, advance, and defend the teaching efforts of the Church, we welcome your much needed help. We ask first that you consider joining us a laborer in the vineyard and become a member or <a href="/involvement?h=chapters">start a chapter</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are able and willing to support CUF financially, we welcome your generous gift. Your support helps ensure CUF’s long-term viability. You can use the form below to make a donation on-line.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most importantly, we ask for your prayers. We know that without God’s grace, our greatest efforts will have no effect. To that end, we point you to the CUF Prayer.
