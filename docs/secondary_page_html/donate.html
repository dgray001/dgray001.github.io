      Our Lord told us in the Gospel of Matthew that the “The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few.”  Indeed, as we work together to support and defend the teaching efforts of the Church, we certainly welcome your much needed help.  We ask first and foremost for your prayers and point you to the CUF Prayer.  Then, if you are able and willing to support the work of Catholics United for the Faith financially, we welcome your generous gift.
