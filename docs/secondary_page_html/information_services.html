    <p>Information Services is the backbone of CUF!</p>
    <p>
      From its beginnings, CUF provided answers to any questions about the Catholic Church;
      questions about doctrine, discipline, or even current events. Those questions usually came
      from members or chapters who were struggling with a particular situation associated with a
      question about the Faith. In the beginning, and for many years, the task of answering those
      questions fell on the shoulders of the officers within CUF. They were the ones preparing
      position papers and evaluating catechism series and liturgical practices.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1997, CUF launched the Information Services (IS) department with a toll-free hotline
      (1-800-MY FAITH [693-2484]) open to anyone who had a question. Anyone, not just members, could
      call and answer any question about the Catholic Church. Under the leadership of Philip C. L.
      Gray serving as Director (1998-2001), IS became the largest and most active program within the
      CUF International Office. During those years, IS received an average of 800 requests and
      distributed more than 83,000 pages of material each month. By the end of 2001, IS had
      researched over 10,000 different questions and issues.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regrettably, after Philip’s departure in September 2001 until CUF’s affiliation to The Saint
      Joseph Foundation (SJF) in February 2017, the IS department went into a decline. Virtually no
      new research occurred after about 2009. With the affiliation, Philip became the President of
      CUF and reinstated the IS department with its toll-free number and mission of answering any
      question about the Catholic Church. The previous research was recovered from the electronic
      files of CUF.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, IS receives questions from <a href="/contact">website</a> and phone inquiries. Anyone
      may contact CUF and ask any question pertaining to the Catholic Church. If IS does not have an
      answer for you, the staff will research your question and provide you with answer. Answers are
      given in writing, either as a <span class="ff">Faith Fact</span> or as a research letter. This
      allows CUF to provide substantive magisterial and scriptural citations that you can reference
      later. CUF members may receive the answers in electronic form. All other inquirers will
      receive the answers by mail.
    </p>
    <p>
      IS staff are available to take questions by phone from 8:00 am until 4:00 pm EST, Monday thru
      Friday. If you have a question about the Catholic Faith, call us at 1-800-MY-FAITH (693-2484)
      or <a href="/contact">contact us</a> via our online form. Relying totally on donations, the
      service is offered free of charge.

  <h2 class="section-title ff">Faith Facts</h2>
  <div class="section-content">
    <p><span class="ff">Faith Facts</span> are the backbone of Information Services (IS).</p>
    <p>
      Each <span class="ff">Faith Fact</span> provides an answer to a common question about the
      Catholic Church. A <span class="ff">Faith Fact</span> generally provides more information than
      a researched letter. Each <span class="ff">Faith Fact</span> is the culmination of many
      research letters and common questions about the Church. Each one provides a question, a
      summary answer, and an expanded discussion that includes context and application. CUF doesn’t
      just explain what the Church teaches or does, we also explain why and how to live the Faith.
      About half of IS inquiries are answered by a <span class="ff">Faith Fact</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below, you can find a comprehensive index of our <span class="ff">Faith Fact</span> organized
      by category. If you have a question that is not answered here, contact IS. Our staff will
      gladly provide an answered tailored to your specific question.
