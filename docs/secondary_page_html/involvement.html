      "Catholics United for the Faith is a lay association of the faithful whose members are its greatest resource. Here in our offices, we provide resources to help you be formed in the Catholic Faith and pursue apostolic activities in keeping with your Baptism. We are here for you, but you are here for Christ and His Church; to be the Salt of the Earth and convert the world from within. We want you to succeed.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3 class="section-subtitle">You can help us help you by doing a few things.</h3>
  <div class="section-content">
    <p>
      First, pray for the success of CUF. If God does not build they house, they labor in vain who build it (Psalm 127:1). Pray that we, and all CUF members, conform our efforts to the Will of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second, encourage engagement with us. I am happy to visit a Chapter, or even just a group of members who are not formed as a Chapter. I have given talks on a variety of topics, and I would be happy to come visit and encourage you in your Faith. Another means of engagement would be to call Information Services and use our FAITH FACTS in personal formation and apostolic outreach. Our materials make a great starting point to engage family, friends, or visitors on matters of the Faith. If you are not sure what we have, call and ask. We will gladly send a list of our FAITH FACTS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, I urge you to seek the Kingdom of God within you. Men of violence are taking the Kingdom of God by force (c.f. Mt. 11:12), one soul at a time. Don’t be a casualty. Join me in this Golden Anniversary of Catholics United for the Faith, as we gather the sheep into the fold of the One True Shepherd, Jesus Christ."
    </p>
    <p>

  <div class="section-content">
    <p>
      Catholics United for the Faith is called an apostolate because membership is ordered to apostolic action. Members first seek personal holiness, so that, should it be God’s will, they are ready instruments for apostolic action.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a lay apostolate, Catholics United for the Faith provides a cooperative structure through which the laity can be effective in their vocation. While an individual might have limited resources, the combined resources of thousands united in effort bring about a greater effect. When an individual seeks to express himself, he remains but one voice, whereas combined with others in an apostolate, his voice is amplified. In turn, the individual benefits from association, through resources and support, in living out his personal vocation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether a person is consecrated, married, single, or ordained; members of an ecclesial movement, religious order, or secular; adherents of a particular piety, spirituality, or devotion; CUF advances the general call to holiness and vocation of the laity and supports each individual’s personal call, however that is manifested.

<h2 id="chapters" class="section-title">CUF Chapters</h2>

<div class="section-content">
  <p>
    CUF members residing in the same area often join together so that their efforts in support of the Catholic faith may bear more fruit. Whenever such a group fulfills the established requirements, it may be given official recognition and charter as a CUF chapter. Chapter members work together to promote authentic spiritual renewal in their own personal lives, in the lives of their families, and in the life of the wider community which comes under their influence. The chapter seeks ways to help its members become knowledgeable about the doctrine and discipline of the Church. The chapter also assists and directs the efforts of its individual members in supporting the efforts of the international office of CUF.
  </p>
  <p>
    The chapter thus provides a local organized structure for supporting the work of the apostolate as a whole. In times of confusion and uncertainty the CUF chapter and all CUF members strive to be a source of stability by bearing clear and unequivocal witness to the authentic doctrine and discipline of the Church in strict fidelity to the Pope and the bishops in union with him.
  </p>
  <p>
    The international office of CUF is located in Hopedale, Ohio, USA. There is a CUF national office in Wellington, New Zealand, as well as individual members all over the world.

<h2 class="section-title">Charter a New Chapter</h2>

<div class="section-content">
  <p>
    <em>We must apply CUF’s mission to address specific, local challenges to faith and orthodoxy. Our chapter members and officers are committed to doing the work of the Church in allegiance to her venerable traditions and her holy teaching authority.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>CUF members understand that they cannot proceed effectively without exemplifying in themselves the primacy of the spiritual-sacramental order of which the Church is the guardian. Our chapter members recognize that they can do much to determine whether a true renewal will occur in the Church or whether forces openly hostile to Catholic doctrine, under the guise of a false “renewal,” will win the day.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>A great need of our day for Catholics is a renewed sense of the adventure of the Church as a guardian of doctrine. She is the champion of the fixed and eternal, and she will always instruct the proud world which finds her out of fashion and mocks her for her steadfastness.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>– Adapted from <em>A Personal Message to Future CUF Chapter Officers</em> from CUF’s founding President, H. Lyman Stebbins</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are interested in chartering a new chapter of Catholics United for the Faith, please <a href='./contact'>contact us</a> to request a Chapter Formation Manual. This brief document outlines why we are convinced CUF chapters are so needed for the renewal of the Church, the kind of apostolic work CUF chapters do, the spirit in which this work is carried out, and the concrete steps you would need to take to charter a chapter. Requesting a manual places you under no obligation to charter a chapter.
