      The Catholic Church identifies those of us living the Faith in the World as “The Church
      Militant”. Those in Purgatory are “The Church Suffering” and those in Heaven are “The Church
      Triumphant”. To secure our place in Heaven, we must not accept the lies of the World. The
      ruler of the World is the Father of Lies and the author of the Culture of Death. As dedicated
      Catholics, we must oppose the lies, the darkness and the death.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the early days of Christianity, Christians have called themselves “Soldiers for Christ”
      to emphasize the constant struggle we endure this side of Heaven. Our baptismal promises
      include a renunciation of the powers of sin and darkness. We renew that promise during every
      Easter Triduum. At our baptism, we were given the power to convert the world from within; to
      be in the world but not of the world (c.f. John 15:18-19).
    </p>
    <p>
      Catholics United for the Faith expects all her members to engage in spiritual and moral
      warfare with an intention to advance the Gospel of Jesus Christ and His Church. That is the
      Gospel of Life. That is revolutionary.

  <h2 class="section-title">What Can You Do?</h2>
  <div class="section-content">
    <p>
      Members are CUF’s cause to exist and its greatest resource. Our Mission is “to unite the
      faithful from all walks of life so they might support, defend, and advance the Teaching Office
      of the Church.” We cannot succeed in a defense of the Gospel of Life if we do not unite in the
      Faith. CUF’s International Office is purposed to encourage membership, unite members in local
      chapters, and provide resources that provide moral and spiritual formation in keeping with the
      Word of God. And, we provide resources to assist members and associates in their individual
      pursuits of apostolic activities in keeping with our baptismal promises.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are here for you, but you are here for Christ and His Church; to be the Salt of the Earth
      and convert the world from within. We want you to succeed.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3 class="section-subtitle">How You Can Help</h3>
  <div class="section-content italics">
    <em>
      <p>
        First, pray for the success of CUF. If God does not build they house, they labor in vain who
        build it (Psalm 127:1). Pray that we, and all CUF members, conform our efforts to the Will
        of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, encourage engagement with us. I am happy to visit a Chapter, or even just a group of
        members who are not formed as a Chapter. I have given talks on a variety of topics, and I
        would be happy to come visit and encourage you in your Faith. Another means of engagement
        would be to call Information Services and use our <span class="ff">Faith Facts</span> in
        personal formation and apostolic outreach. Our materials make a great starting point to
        engage family, friends, or visitors on matters of the Faith. If you are not sure what we
        have, call and ask. We will gladly send a list of our <span class="ff">Faith Facts</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, I urge you to seek the Kingdom of God within you. Men of violence are taking the
        Kingdom of God by force (c.f. Mt. 11:12), one soul at a time. Don’t be a casualty. Join me
        in this Golden Anniversary of Catholics United for the Faith, as we gather the sheep into
        the fold of the One True Shepherd, Jesus Christ."

    <p>
      Catholics United for the Faith is called an apostolate because membership is ordered to
      apostolic action. Members first seek personal holiness, so that they are ready instruments for
      evangelistic action.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a lay apostolate, Catholics United for the Faith provides a cooperative structure through
      which the laity can be effective in their vocation. While an individual might have limited
      resources, the combined resources of thousands united in effort bring about a greater effect.
      When an individual seeks to express himself, he remains but one voice. Whereas, combined with
      others in an apostolate, his voice is amplified. In turn, the individual benefits from
      association, through resources and support, in living out his personal vocation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether a person is consecrated, married, single, or ordained; members of an ecclesial
      movement, religious order, or secular; adherents of a particular piety, spirituality, or
      devotion; CUF advances the general call to holiness and vocation of the laity and supports
      each individual’s personal call, however that is manifested.

  <div class="section-content">
    <p>
      Catholics United for the Faith encourages members to unite in a common endeavor. CUF members
      residing in the same area often join together so that their efforts in support of the Catholic
      faith may bear more fruit. Whenever such a group fulfills the established requirements, it may
      be given official recognition and charter as a CUF chapter. Chapter members work together to
      promote authentic spiritual and moral renewal in their own personal lives, in the lives of
      their families, and in the life of the wider community which comes under their influence. The
      chapter seeks ways to help its members become knowledgeable about the doctrines and
      disciplines of the Church. The chapter also assists and directs the efforts of its individual
      members in supporting the efforts of the international office of CUF.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chapter provides a local, organized structure for supporting the work of the apostolate as
      a whole. In times of confusion and uncertainty the CUF chapter and all CUF members strive to
      be a source of stability by bearing clear witness to the authentic doctrines and disciplines
      of the Church in fidelity to the Pope and the bishops in union with him.
    </p>
    <p>The international office of CUF is located in Hopedale, Ohio, USA.</p>

  <h2 class="section-title">Charter a New Chapter</h2>
  <div class="section-content">
    <em>
      <p>
        We must apply CUF’s mission to address specific, local challenges to faith and orthodoxy.
        Our chapter members and officers are committed to doing the work of the Church in allegiance
        to her venerable traditions and her holy teaching authority.
      </p>
      <p>
        CUF members understand that they cannot proceed effectively without exemplifying in
        themselves the primacy of the spiritual-sacramental order of which the Church is the
        guardian. Our chapter members recognize that they can do much to determine whether a true
        renewal will occur in the Church or whether forces openly hostile to Catholic doctrine,
        under the guise of a false “renewal,” will win the day.
      </p>
      <p>
        A great need of our day for Catholics is a renewed sense of the adventure of the Church as a
        guardian of doctrine. She is the champion of the fixed and eternal, and she will always
        instruct the proud world which finds her out of fashion and mocks her for her steadfastness.

      If you are interested in chartering a new chapter of Catholics United for the Faith, please
      <a href="/contact">contact us</a> to request a Chapter Formation Manual. This brief document
      outlines why we are convinced CUF chapters are so needed for the renewal of the Church, the
      kind of apostolic work CUF chapters do, the spirit in which this work is carried out, and the
      concrete steps you would need to take to charter a chapter.
