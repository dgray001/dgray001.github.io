    <em><b>In the wake of Vatican II, many Catholics were confused. Many were in error. Had the Church changed her teachings? A courageous group of laymen banded together in 1968 to defend the Truth. The Truth is, the Church did not change her Teachings. The Mystical Body of Christ was under attack then and remains under attack now. As in 1968, her enemies come from within and without. Our Mother still needs to be defended. That is what Catholics United for the Faith was founded for, and that is what we do today.</b></em>

      Catholics United for the Faith (CUF) is an international lay apostolate founded to unite the Faithful from all walks of like in order to support, defend, and advance the Teaching Office of the Catholic Church. CUF is faithful to the Magisterium of the Church, holding that the Church is indefectible and will not fail, that Her teachings can develop but never fundamentally change. CUF seeks to support the hierarchy in proclaiming the saving truths, but is not afraid to warn the faithful against error and immorality wherever it appears. CUF is committed to assisting Catholics of all states in life to participate in the Church’s apostolic activity, reform existing activities, and even found their own apostolates where this is needed. In these ways, CUF pursues and supports authentic Church Reform.
    </p>
    <p>
      CUF fulfills the objective of defending the Church, and of uniting the faithful of all states in life to defend the Church, in practical ways such as:

  <div class="section-content">
    <p>
      CUF, and its mission, were the fruit of much prayer and discussion by a group of devout laymen concerned with a wide array of attacks and distortions facing the Catholic Church. Matters came to a head with the publication of Pope Paul VI’s Humanae Vitae, and the immediate wave of dissent it garnered from a large number of bishops, priests, and theologians. In the face of such scandalous revolt, CUF’s founders felt compelled to serve as lay witnesses of fidelity to Peter, to the Church, and thus to Christ. These founders of CUF never dreamed of how influential the apostolate would be, but they knew what needed to be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1968: <em>A new Apostolate is born!</em></b>  In September of 1968, H. Lyman Stebbins was chosen to serve as the founding president of CUF. In the years since its founding, CUF has influenced the founding of numerous apostolic initiatives, advanced the role of the laity in the Church and helped tens of thousands of people discover and strengthen their Catholic faith. Put bluntly, CUF has directly contributed to the life of the Church in North America in notable ways.

    <p>
      <b>1968-Present: <em>Pro-Life</em></b>  Since CUF’s earliest days, our members have dedicated themselves to defending the child in the womb and advancing the Culture of Life. CUF members participate in statewide Right to Life organizations and state and national Marches for Life. They pray outside of abortion clinics, counsel women to choose life, offer aid through crisis pregnancy centers, combat pro-euthanasia bills at state legislatures and much more.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1970’s-1990’s/Present: <em>Challenging Poor Catechesis and Sex Education!</em></b>  CUF officers, chapters and individual members have long produced in-depth reviews of catechetical  and sex education programs used in parishes and Catholic schools. They pointed out, in charity, where these programs are in conflict with Catholic teaching. Members have fought tirelessly to remove problematic programs from Catholic curriculums. CUF’s Information Services continues this essential activity today.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1970-Present: <em>Award winning publication!</em></b>  CUF began publishing its Lay Witness newsletter more than 50 years ago. What began as a newsletter for members developed into a full-color magazine with a variety of articles between 1997 and 2014. Published today as a bi-monthly newsletter, Lay Witness provides timely articles on the Faith and keeps members informed of CUF activities.

      <b>1984: <em>A Sister Apostolate!</em></b>  Chuck Wilson, a convert from the Episcopal Church, was deeply influenced by the invitation to community and formation he received as a member of CUF’s Houston Chapter. In 1984, he founded CUF’s sister apostolate The Saint Joseph Foundation, to assist the Faithful in the vindication of their rights within the Law of the Catholic Church. Learn more about the Saint Joseph Foundation at stjosephcanonlaw.com.

      <b>1986: <em>Luther in reverse!</em></b>  As a new convert to Catholicism, Dr. Scott Hahn struggled to find a community of zealous, devout Catholics to grow with him in the Catholic Faith. That is, until he was introduced to his local CUF chapter in Milwaukee. St. Gregory VII Chapter of CUF is still meeting in Milwaukee, and Scott Hahn is still Catholic.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1987: <em>Faith and Life!</em></b>  Reviewing catechetical series and flagging errors is not enough, CUF must lead by example. In 1987, CUF published the renowned Faith and Life catechism series for grades 1-8. CUF would later add a kindergarten year to the series, as well as teacher editions and handbooks for students. This full-service catechism series is widely used by parish catechetical programs, Catholic schools, and homeschooling parents. Published exclusively by Ignatius Press, the beloved series is in its third edition and can be purchased in hard copy, as an online program, or as an eBook.

      <b>1988: <em>A Knight to remember!</em></b>  On January 10, 1988, H. Lyman Stebbins was made a Knight Commander of the Order of St. Gregory the Great by Pope St. John Paul II. This high honor was given in recognition of his role as the founding president of CUF and the subsequent role CUF accepted in pursuing authentic reforms within the Church. Stebbins would die the following year, on February 22, 1989.

      <b>1998: <em>Another apostolate is born!</em></b>  During his tenure as President, Curtis Martin launched an ambitious CUF initiative aimed at capturing the hearts and minds of America’s college students for Christ: Fellowship of Catholic University Students. Curtis felt called to give his full attention and energy into this quickly growing movement, and in 1998 FOCUS was founded as its own organization under Curtis Martin’s leadership.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1998: <em>Our hearts are burning within us!</em></b>  CUF’s long history of research and defense of the Faith produced countless reviews and a few books. Why not more? Emmaus Road Publishing was launched by Curtis Martin in response to the Pope’s call for a new evangelization. CUF’s publishing arm naturally grew out of an apostolic desire to place inspiring and orthodox Bible studies into the hands of Faith hungry Catholics. Sold to the St. Paul Center for Biblical Theology in 2014, Emmaus Road Publishing continues to offer titles that invite readers to dive deeper into the Word of God and the Catholic Faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2017: <em>Uniting the Faithful from all walks of life!</em></b>  CUF affiliated to its longtime sister apostolate, The Saint Joseph Foundation (SJF) in February of 2017. By restructuring its membership to include “affiliates”, CUF expanded its outreach. By sharing office space and resources, both apostolates keep costs down and put more of your donations directly into advancing their complimentary missions. Read below about how the sister apostolates are organized.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>2018: <em>Golden Anniversary!</em></b>  CUF celebrated 50 years of uniting the Faithful from all walks of life to support, defend and advance the Teachings of the Catholic Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Today: <em>A threshold of Hope!</em></b>  Every day, CUF is connecting Truth-seekers and devout Catholics with the information, resources, and community they need to grow in the Faith and be instruments of renewal. CUF wants you to enter the spring-time of Faith and cross the threshold of Hope. Connect with CUF, fall in love with Christ, and be part of the renewal of His Church.

      In 2014, the President of CUF recommended that the apostolate wind down operations and dissolve. The Board of Directors rejected the proposal, Over the next two years, a painful transition began. CUF sold its office space and all real estate. Emmaus Road Publishing was sold to the Saint Paul Center, and all staff except the Executive Vice President were hired by Saint Paul Center to continue running Emmaus Road. CUF’s library was given away. It’s business files and some of its research was moved to storage. CUF’s Executive Vice President, Shannon Minch-Hughes, continued to fulfill requests for <a href="/faith_facts" class="ff">Faith Facts</a> and any other request she was able to fulfill. Publication of Lay Witness was suspended.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this time, discussions began with The Saint Joseph Foundation (SJF) to acquire CUF in some way. Philip Gray, the President of SJF, served as Director of Information Services at CUF from 1998 – 2001. From 2000 – 2001, he also served as Director of Development and Membership Services. Wanting to preserve the essential mission of CUF, he proposed that CUF be affiliated to SJF. In this way, CUF would remain an autonomous Catholic apostolate with no change to its structure with one exception: the Directors and Officers of SJF would be ex officio Directors and Officers of CUF. The proposal was accepted by both Boards of Directors, and on February 4, 2017, CUF became affiliated to SJF.
    </p>
    <p>
      This arrangement allowed CUF to move its operations into the offices of SJF. The exceptional research library and files of SJF became available to CUF. The arrangement provided all the essential elements needed to continue CUF’s Mission. By sharing office space and resources with SJF, both apostolates are able to support each other’s complimentary missions. Best of all, because SJF was a sister apostolate of CUF, the Directors and Officers of SJF value the Mission and work of CUF in the Church. Since 2017, the two apostolates have supported each other in every way possible without altering their own identities or missions. Two sisters under one roof.
