            We will answer any question about the Catholic Faith. Anyone may call and ask questions pertaining to the Catholic Church, Faith or teachings. We have staff available to take questions from 8:00 am until 4:00 pm EST, Monday - Friday. We prefer to answer questions in writing as this allows us to provide substantive references to magisterial and scriptural references.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our <a href="./information_services#faith_facts">Faith Facts</a> support this service. Each Faith Fact is a carefully researched article that offers a clear, concise and accurate discussion on topics relating to the Catholic Faith. At the end of the Faith Fact, we offer a partial list of other Faith Facts available. If a person calls, and we have a Faith Fact prepared on the question they ask, we will send it to them. If  we have not prepared a Faith Fact on that topic, we will research the issue and send a letter addressing their particular question.
          </p>
